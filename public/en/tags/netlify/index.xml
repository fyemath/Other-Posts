      <description>Netlify is a great place to host a website directly from github. If you have multiple repositories and want to publish them under the same domain. There are two way to do it. You may also redirect a subdirectory of your personal site to a netlify site. However, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem possible to redirect a netlify site to a subdirectory.
Redirect netlify sites to domains or subdomains If you have a personal domain/subdomains, you can easily redirect a netlify site to your domain or a subdomain.</description>
