      <description>There are different ways to include a picture in Rmarkdown. The basic way is to use ![caption](path/to/picture.extension). If the figure is not in an bookdown theorem environment, you may also use knitr.
```{r figure, echo=FALSE}knitr::include_graphics(path/to/picture.extension)```The way using knitr to include graphics provide more options to control the dimension and position of a figure. For details, you may read Yihui&amp;rsquo;s knitr manual on plots.
Because I normally have to include pictures in theorem environment in bookdown.</description>

      <description>When using LaTeX template with customized theorem environments in R bookdown, you may see an error say a thereom environment is defined. Checking the output LaTex files, you will find that bookdown generated theorem enviroment at the end of the LaTeX preamble. To solve the problem, currently, one may use the magical bookdown.post.latex option. Adding the following code at the beginning of the index.Rmd file will remove the injected theorem environments.</description>

      <description>In mathematics, we write a lot definitions, theorem etc. and refer to them in articles. However, among the Rmarkdown family, only bookdown has all those features that you need. Fortunately, Yihui created a feature base_format for bookdown which allows us to port it to amost all format in Rmarkdown family. Here is an example how you can do it and you may always want to write your yaml header in this way.</description>
