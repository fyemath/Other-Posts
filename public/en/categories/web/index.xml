      <description>Multiple Blogs on One Site1 Suppose that you have two categories of blogs. There are two ways to create directories in your website folder
  --blog1 |--_posts --blog2 |--_post   |--_posts |--blog1 |--blog2   The first approach will automatically assign categories to your posts.
Using the second approach, you will need to manually add category: your_blog_folder_name to Yaml Front Matter in each post.
--- layout: default title: Blog1 category: blog1 --- You also need to modify the default layout template for the category blog1 by adding a filter using post.</description>

      <description>Using jQuery to Open External Links in New Windows1 Creating (static) webpages using markdown is every convenient, for example
[Queensborough Community College](http://www.qcc.cuny.edu). However, left clicking a link by default opens it in the same window. If there are only a few links, one may use html codes to open a link in a new window, for example
&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;http://www.qcc.cuny.edu&amp;#34; target=&amp;#34;_blank&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Queensborough Community College&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. When there are many links it will be a little bit painful to create such links using html in a markdown file.</description>
